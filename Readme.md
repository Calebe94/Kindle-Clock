# WebLaunch #

WebLaunch is an extension for the Kindle Touch ( and probably the Kindle PaperWhite too ) with JailBreak and the application launcher KUAL. It is designed to open a URL without the browser frame (the black status bar can be removed too) to make it look like a native application.

## Installation ##

* Make sure your Kindle Touch is already Jailbreaked
* Make sure you have KUAL installed and the "extensions" folder exists 
* Copy the WebLaunch folder to the "extensions" folder ( don't rename it without changing bin/start.sh first )
* Copy the settings.example.cfg in the WebLaunch folder to settings.cfg and change its contents to fit your needs

## Background ##

WebLaunch is based on "mesquite" former WAF and utilizes the "Kindle" template library and a few system librarys based on it to bring as much native browser behaviour as possible. Configuration is supplied as an argument in form of a escaped JSON object, which is automatically generated by bin/start.sh. The start script therefore reads the file settings.cfg, escapes its contents and appends this string as an argument to the launcher command. Some parts int this could be better but it works.

## Notes ##

Special thanks go to the folks at mobileread.com for their great work opening up the Kindle.
